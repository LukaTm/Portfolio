Website hosted on Netlify - https://markuss-portfolio.netlify.app/

A dynamic portfolio homepage, featuring sections for "Home", "Skills", "Projects", and "Contact". This design enhances the user experience with both dark and light modes, dynamic animations using CSS transformations, interactive cubes that respond to mouse movements and change as you scroll. Additionally, text and project elements smoothly slide into view as you scroll down the page. The "Contact Me" function has also been implemented, allowing users to send an email to me.
